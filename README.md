# anti-tumor-therapeutic-analysis
#### **Objective:** 

Analyze the results of an animal study testing experimental anti-cancer drugs

#### **Background:** 

A pharmaceutical company is screening for potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a form of skin cancer. In this study, 249 mice identified with SCC tumor growth were treated through a variety of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. 

#### **Method:** 

- Data Cleaning: Duplicate mice were identified and removed. Data was organized into a data frame.
- Generated a summary statistics table consisting of the mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and SEM of the tumor volume for each drug regimen.
- Generated a bar plot using Matplotlib that shows the number of total mice for each treatment regimen throughout the course of the study.
- Generated a pie plot using Matplotlib that shows the distribution of female or male mice in the study.
- Calculated the final tumor volume of each mouse across four of the most promising treatment regimens: Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin. 
- Calculated the quartiles and IQR to determine if there are any potential outliers.
- Generated a box and whisker plot of the final tumor volume and highlighted outliers in red.
- Generated a line plot of tumor volume vs. time point for a specific Capomulin-treated mouse.
- Generated a scatter plot of mouse weight versus average tumor volume for the Capomulin treatment regimen.
- Calculated the correlation coefficient and linear regression model between mouse weight and average tumor volume. 
- Plotted the linear regression model on top of the previous scatter plot.
